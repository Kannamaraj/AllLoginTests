# login-tests

## Goal
* Create an exhaustive list of scenarios for login page test

## Login Page
* Consider a simple login page with `username field`, `password field`, `login button`, `forgot password link`, `remember me checkbox` and `create new account button` 
* `username field` and `password field` have placeholders/hint text.
* A Captcha is displayed after 5 unsuccessful login attemps
* Successful login directs user to the homepage

## Note
* The project has a feature file titled `loginTests.feature`, this contains test cases that can be automated
* Add scenarios that should not be automated OR require manual intervention to the `loginTests.txt` file with elaborate steps
* Please feel free to add  scenarios to the feature or tx files by submitting a PR
